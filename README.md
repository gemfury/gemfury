This is the Gemfury CLI used to manage your Gemfury packages from the command line.  If you're
familiar with the service and want to jump straight into command line action, please proceed to
the [CLI documentation](http://devcenter.gemfury.com/articles/gemfury-cli.html).

Gemfury is your personal cloud for your private and custom RubyGems, Python packages, and NPM
modules.  Once you upload your packages and enable Gemfury as a source, you can securely deploy
any package to any host. It's simple, reliable, and hassle-free.
